## General Information
Simple coffee quality analysis from dataset available from Coffee Quality Institute - January 2018. Dataset was done by James LeDoux - https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database. I'm interested only in arabica coffee and its quality. I would like to explore this dataset and see what stands behind quality of some arabica coffee. Each coffee in this dataset has been reviewed by Coffee Cuper - specialized reviewer that gives coffee quality points.
